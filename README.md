### Abstract
In 3D surface imaging, the projector and the camera must be synchronized to achieve the fastest possible acquisition speed and to avoid unwanted artifacts in the acquired images. Most of the current solutions for camera and projector synchronization are expensive and require custom hardware solutions. Software only synchronization solution is described which allows for low cost 3D surface imaging, requiring no additional hardware components. Other existing synchronization methods of the camera and the projector are classified. The requirements for implementing software synchronization on different platforms are described. A solution for software-only synchronization and image acquisition of Basler video cameras and is added to the existing software for structured light imaging.
